Briefly summarize what are Flask Context Globals

Flask context globals are variables that are accessible to a thread whilst a context is activated
while not impeding or affecting other threads. With the application context active, the current
application object (current_app) and temporary storage variable (g) are available for the current
thread to use. Similarly, activating the request context allows the contents of the HTTP request
object (request) and the current user session's parameters (session) to be available for use. If
neither context is activated, any attempt to reference these context globals will error out.
